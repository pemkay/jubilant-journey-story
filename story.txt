Despite having argued about where to eat for ages, Esther and Nathan still haven't decided on a restaurant. At this point, I've realized that we are most likely going to end up ordering food and eating at Esther's apartment, but the other two were still debating between Paul's and Chen's. I'm just really hungry.
My hungry belly and I decide that enough is enough. I end up just going to Paul's and ordering take out. After the dinner, we plan to go to the movies together.
